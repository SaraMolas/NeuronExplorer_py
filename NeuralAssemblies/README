## Inputs:

The scripts in this folder require certain variables to be computed beforehand: 
- spike_times.npy: vector containing the timestamps of all neural spikes in a given session.
- spike_clusters.npy: vector containing the cell ID of all neural spikes in a given session.
- times_run.npy: vector with behavioural timestamps for a given session.
- positions_run.npy: vector with positions for each behavioural timestamp for a given session.
- speed_run.npy: vector of speed for each behavioural timestamp for a given session.
- trials_run.npy: vector of trial number for each behavioural timestamp for a given session.
- disambiguatingCells.npy: vector with the cell ID of all neurons classified as 'disambiguating cells' in a given session. 
- placeCells.npy: vector with the cell ID of all neurons identified as place cells in a given session. 

## Outputs: 

The scripts in this folder output the following file: 
- weights.csv: csv-file containing the weight vectors of all neural assemblies for a given session.
- principalCells.npy: numpy array containing the cell IDs of the principal cells of each neural assembly for a given session.
- ratioDisCells.npy: vector containing the ratio of disambiguation cells out of the principal cells of each neural assembly for a given session. 
- ratioRandomPlaceCells.npy: vector containing the ratio of randomly-selected place cells out of the principal cells of each neural assembly for a given session. 
- meanDisCells.npy: vector containing the mean ratio of disambiguating cells per neural assembly across all sessions.
- meanRandomPlaceCells.npy: vector containing the mean ratio of randomly-selected place cells per neural assembly across all sessions.
